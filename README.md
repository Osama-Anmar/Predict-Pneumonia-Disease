# Predict-Pneumonia-Disease
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting pneumonia using chest X-ray images. The project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to classify images as either pneumonia or normal.

# Introduction
Pneumonia is a severe respiratory infection that affects the lungs and can be life-threatening, especially for children and the elderly. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to automate the diagnosis of pneumonia by analyzing chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques.

# Model Architecture
* The model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is well-suited for image classification tasks. 
* The architecture includes several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and fully connected layers.
* The model is trained to minimize binary cross-entropy loss and uses accuracy as the evaluation metric.

# Key Components:
* Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the input images.
* Max-Pooling Layers: Reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
* Fully Connected Layers: Classify the images based on the extracted features.
